# Acute Malnutrition Forecasting Tool (AMFT)

AMFT is a Streamlit-based decision-support tool for district-level acute malnutrition monitoring in Uganda. It combines anomaly detection, short-term forecasting, geospatial visualization, data quality checks, and model evaluation to support early warning and operational planning.

The current version focuses on three connected outputs:

- 4-level anomaly classification for within-district and between-district monitoring
- 3-level operational alerts derived from anomaly combinations
- 3-month district forecasts of GAM caseloads with uncertainty bounds

## What Changed in the Current Tool

The README has been updated to reflect the current app behavior. The tool now uses:

- anomaly levels of `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`, and `Extreme`
- operational alerts of `Monitor`, `Alert`, and `Respond`
- 3-month recursive forecasting with `Lower_80` and `Upper_80` intervals
- district filtering across the full app
- observed and forecast map views for anomalies and operational alerts
- built-in data quality summaries for districts and months
- regression model checks inside the app
- optional IPC AMN severity labeling when direct GAM prevalence columns are available

## Core Capabilities

- Load district monthly GAM caseload data from a local path or file upload
- Load district boundaries from a local GeoJSON path or file upload
- Classify observed GAM caseloads using district-relative and peer-relative anomaly rules
- Generate operational alerts from within-district and between-district anomaly combinations
- Forecast district GAM caseloads for the next 3 months
- Display forecast uncertainty with 80% intervals
- Compare districts or regions against a national reference trend
- Explore Spearman correlations between GAM caseload and covariates
- Review regression and classification model performance
- Download classified observed data and forecast outputs

## Risk Framework

### 1. Anomaly Classification

Observed and forecast anomaly labels use percentile thresholds:

| Level | Threshold | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Low` | Below 75th percentile | Within the usual range |
| `Moderate` | 75th to below 90th percentile | Higher than usual |
| `High` | 90th to below 95th percentile | Unusually high |
| `Extreme` | 95th percentile and above | Exceptionally high |

### 2. Operational Alert

Operational alerts are derived from the combination of within-district and between-district anomaly levels:

| Operational Alert | Rule | Typical Action |
|---|---|---|
| `Monitor` | Within = `Low` and Between = `Low` or `Moderate` | Routine monitoring |
| `Alert` | Within = `Low` and Between = `High` or `Extreme`, or Within = `Moderate` and Between = `Low` or `Moderate` | Heightened surveillance |
| `Respond` | Within = `High` or `Extreme`, or Within = `Moderate` and Between = `High` or `Extreme` | Immediate response |

### 3. IPC AMN Severity

If the dataset includes direct GAM prevalence columns such as WHZ- or MUAC-based prevalence, the app can also compute observed IPC AMN severity phases:

- `Acceptable`
- `Alert`
- `Serious`
- `Critical`
- `Extremely Critical`

If prevalence data are not present, the app still supports anomaly-based early warning and GAM caseload forecasting.

## How the App Works

The application follows this workflow:

1. Load monthly district GAM data.
2. Parse dates and standardize district labels.
3. Calculate within-district anomalies from each district's own historical distribution.
4. Calculate between-district anomalies from peer district and seasonal patterns.
5. Harmonize diarrhea inputs, sanitize impossible values, cap extreme modeled covariates, and create missingness and outlier indicator features.
6. Apply target QC flags for suspicious GAM spikes or duplicate district-month rows.
7. Engineer lagged, rolling, trend, seasonal, and district-relative features.
8. Train Random Forest models for regression and anomaly classification.
9. Generate 3-month recursive district forecasts.
10. Convert forecast outputs into anomaly labels and operational alerts.
11. Visualize current conditions, historical patterns, drivers, forecasts, and model checks.

## System Architecture

The tool is designed for integration with DHIS2 and the Climate Health Analytics Platform (CHAP).

![System setup in the DHIS2 eco system](Screenshots/architecture.png)

## CHAP Integration

This repository now includes a CHAP-compatible model interface at the project root:

- `MLproject`
- `MLProject.yaml`
- `train.py`
- `predict.py`
- `chap_model.py`
- `pyproject.toml`

### CHAP entrypoints

The model follows the CHAP external-model contract:

- `train` takes `train_data` and `model`
- `predict` takes `historic_data`, `future_data`, `model`, and `out_file`

The `MLproject` file exposes these entrypoints so the model can be run directly by CHAP.
`MLProject.yaml` is also included for compatibility with CHAP model-template seeding flows that fetch metadata from GitHub.

### Input schema

The CHAP-facing scripts accept the standard CHAP column names:

- `time_period`
- `location`
- `disease_cases` for `train_data` and `historic_data`

Optional covariates supported by the model:

- `mean_temperature`
- `rainfall`
- `mean_relative_humidity`
- `average_gpp`
- `malaria_confirmed` for malaria cases among children under 5
- `pneumonia_cases` for pneumonia cases among children under 5
- `diarrhea` for diarrhoea cases among children under 5
- `low_birth_weight_babies` for low birth weight newborns
- `population` for the district under-5 population

For this project, the non-climate child-health covariates are interpreted as children under 5 years of age. In practice this means:

- `malaria_confirmed`, `pneumonia_cases`, and `diarrhea` are under-5 case counts
- `population` is the under-5 population denominator
- `low_birth_weight_babies` remains a neonatal indicator used as an input covariate

For backward compatibility with older datasets, the wrapper also accepts:

- `Region_District` as a fallback for `location`
- `Acut_Malnutrition` as a fallback for `disease_cases`
- legacy `diarrhea_acute` and `diarrhea_persistent`, which are combined into `diarrhea`

### Missing covariate handling

The CHAP and Streamlit pipelines now use the same rule-based missing-data workflow for modeled covariates:

- GAM target values are not imputed for training
- climate covariates are interpolated within district/location, then filled from district/location-month medians, then district/location medians
- child-health covariates use a 1-month forward fill, then district/location-month medians, then district/location medians
- `population` uses within-district/location forward fill and back fill before median fallback
- each modeled covariate also generates a companion `*_missing` feature so the model can learn whether the original value was observed or imputed

For CHAP prediction inputs, if a future covariate column is omitted entirely, the model treats it as missing rather than forcing it to zero.

### Outlier and target handling

Modeled covariates and GAM targets are handled differently:

- impossible covariate values are converted to missing before preprocessing, for example negative child-health counts, non-positive `population`, negative `rainfall`, negative `average_gpp`, or humidity outside `0-100`
- extreme modeled covariates are capped within district/location using a robust median plus/minus `5 * MAD` rule, and each modeled covariate also gets a companion `*_outlier` indicator
- GAM targets are not winsorized by default, because true spikes may be the signal of interest
- impossible GAM target values such as negative caseloads are converted to missing and excluded from training
- GAM target QC is tracked with `target_outlier_qc` and `target_duplicate_qc` flags so suspicious spikes or duplicate district-month observations can be reviewed without flattening the target series

### Output schema

The `predict` entrypoint writes a CHAP-compatible CSV with:

- `time_period`
- `location`
- `sample_0` through `sample_99`

Each `sample_*` column is one forecast draw derived from the fitted random forest, which allows CHAP to calculate uncertainty intervals.

Optional enriched CHAP output is also available when needed for downstream testing:

- set `CHAP_INCLUDE_RISK_OUTPUT=1` when using `predict.py`; or
- run `python chap_model.py predict ... --include-risk-output`

When enabled, the prediction CSV appends:

- `point_forecast`
- `wd_risk`
- `xd_risk`
- `Operational_Alert`
- `Operational_Alert_Why`
- `Composite_Risk`

This keeps the default CHAP sample output unchanged while allowing risk-label and operational-alert testing in environments that can tolerate extra columns.

### Local smoke-test example

Once dependencies are installed, the CHAP path can be exercised locally with:

```bash
python train.py /path/to/train.csv /tmp/model.pkl
python predict.py /tmp/model.pkl /path/to/historic.csv /path/to/future.csv /tmp/predictions.csv
CHAP_INCLUDE_RISK_OUTPUT=1 python predict.py /tmp/model.pkl /path/to/historic.csv /path/to/future.csv /tmp/predictions_with_risk.csv
```

## Installation

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment

Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The default local address is:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

## Running With Sample Data

The app already points to local sample files by default:

- `data/sample/Acute_Malnutrition_data_district.csv`
- `data/sample/uganda-districts_ug.geojson`

In the sidebar you can choose either:

- `Use local CSV path` / `Use local GeoJSON path`
- `Upload CSV` / `Upload GeoJSON`

When a GeoJSON is provided, the app asks you to select the district name column used for matching.

## Data Requirements

### Required columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Region_District` | Region and district label, for example `Acholi|Agago District` |
| `District` | District name |
| `Region` | Region name |
| `time_period` | Monthly date such as `2020-01` |
| `Acut_Malnutrition` | GAM caseload, interpreted in the app as SAM + MAM |
| `mean_temperature` | Mean temperature |
| `rainfall` | Rainfall |
| `mean_relative_humidity` | Relative humidity |
| `average_gpp` | Vegetation productivity |
| `malaria_confirmed` | Malaria cases among children under 5 |
| `pneumonia_cases` | Pneumonia cases among children under 5 |
| `diarrhea` | Diarrhoea cases among children under 5 |
| `low_birth_weight_babies` | Low birth weight newborns |
| `population` | District under-5 population |

Missing values in these covariates are handled internally using the rule-based workflow described above. The model also creates missingness and outlier indicator features for each modeled covariate.

### Optional severity columns

Observed IPC AMN severity can be calculated if the dataset includes a direct GAM prevalence column. The app checks for common WHZ- and MUAC-based naming variants such as:

- `gam_whz`
- `gam_whz_pct`
- `gam_muac`
- `gam_muac_pct`

### GeoJSON requirements

- Upload or point to a district-level GeoJSON
- Select the GeoJSON column that contains district names
- Ensure district names match the CSV closely enough for joining

## Model Approach

### Regression

A `RandomForestRegressor` is used to forecast district GAM caseloads for the next 3 months.
Forecast anomaly labels and operational alerts are derived from the regression forecast rather than emitted by a classifier in the forecasting path.

### Features

The model pipeline uses:

- climate covariates plus under-5 disease and population covariates
- lagged values
- rolling summaries
- seasonality features
- district-relative thresholds
- recent anomaly history
- trend and acceleration signals

## Outputs You Can Download

- classified observed CSV
- forecast CSV
- within-district anomaly metrics CSV
- between-district anomaly metrics CSV

## Screens

### Current Situation and Observed Maps

The app shows side-by-side summaries for:

- within-district anomaly
- between-districts anomaly
- operational alert

It also renders observed district maps when a GeoJSON is provided.

## Notes and Limitations

- Forecast accuracy depends on data quality, completeness, and reporting consistency.
- Rule-based imputation can stabilize training and prediction, but large or systematic source-data gaps can still bias the model.
- Extreme GAM spikes are retained by default and only flagged for QC, so known reporting artifacts should still be reviewed during analysis.
- The anomaly labels are percentile-based early-warning indicators, not direct clinical diagnosis.
- Severity phases require direct GAM prevalence data and may be unavailable in many datasets.
- GeoJSON district naming mismatches can prevent map joins.
- Model outputs should be interpreted alongside field surveillance and program context.
